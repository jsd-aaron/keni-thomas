        <p>No one raised their hand that day
When they asked for volunteers
He got picked out by default
            He was the only daddy there</p>
<p>
They said we know what you're thinking
Choose someone else instead
But this league is built on coaches
Who stood right there and said
</p>
<p>
Not me, not me, no way with this job of mine
I could never find the time not me, not me
The world becomes a better place when
Someone stands and leads the way
Steps forward when they'd rather say, not me
</p>
<p>
The judge says you're the oldest
May choose a legal guardian
I'm sorry that you lost your folks
But there's no next of kin</p>
